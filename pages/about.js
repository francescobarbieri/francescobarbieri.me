                                Hey, I'm Francesco an Italian software
                                developer.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                I currently live near Milan, in the north of
                                Italy. I was weaned as a software developer on
                                school, starting with my first computer, an old
                                Toshiba laptop my grandfather left me when I was
                                young. I've also spent significant time writing
                                PHP, Javascript and Java code in personal and/or
                                University projects. Currently learning Python
                                and System Design in my free time.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                I have a particular interest in the human side
                                of computers and the ways we interact with them.
                                They are fascinating machines, but they have
                                many implications that we often tend to forget.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Currently I'm a third year CS student and I will
                                graduate this year. Actively searching for a
                                prestigious internship.

                                writing. But also because I felt the need to
                                track all of my progress in software development
                                - whatever topic I'm working on. Lastly I think
                                that researching things I find interesting and
                                then re-elaborate on them can help give me more
                                clarity in thoughts.
