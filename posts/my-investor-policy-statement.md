Dear readers, to start the “Finance” section of this blog aiming to inspire and encourage open discussions about investing and personal finance I want to share with you my [IPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ips.asp).

What’s an IPS? An IPS is a list of your investing goals and strategies, incorporating your risk tolerance, desired asset allocation, and specific plans to achieve them. The level of details that you can put in this, vastly depends on your situation. A too detailed IPS may end up in editing it too frequently, while a too generic IPS is mostly worthless.

Do you need an IPS? Need is a rather forceful word, but as many personal finance investors suggest, everyone that is going to invest money should have one. Basically you’re forcing yourself to think about your values, your long term strategy and if you really understand what and why you’re investing in. If you are currently investing I suggest you to write your own following [this](https://www.physicianonfire.com/you-need-an-investor-policy-statement/) post from [physicianonfire](https://www.physicianonfire.com/).

As my life continues to unfold, I’ll be making updates and changes, according to the progress of my journey. Each time I make a revision, I’ll update the date of this post. To keep some sort of “versioning control”, at the end I’ll write some notes for those modifications that needs an explanation or are backed by an analysis.

Enjoy!

### Objectives

- Long-term growth: My primary objective is to achieve steady long-term (more than 10 years) capital appreciation.
- Wealth preservation: I aim to preserve my wealth, considering inflation and the future financial needs of myself.

### Investment philosophy

- I will handle my investments myself: no active investing, no financial advisors (only for one-off), no robo-advisors.
- Invest mainly in low cost ETFs.
- Invest in single bonds if I need to allocate money for an expected future expense.
- No sector/themes ETFs.
- Buy and hold stocks strategy: stay invested (and extra invest if possible) if the market crashes.
- Review and rebalance the strategy every 2 years.

### Asset class ranking

Defining asset classes to invest:

1. Stocks (ETF): good
2. Bonds (individual): good
3. Bonds (ETF): probably good (need to go into detail)
4. Commodities and precious metals: no plans for now, not a huge fan
5. Private equities / Angel investing: no plans for now, but maybe in the future
6. Real Estates: not in the short/mid term (need to go into detail)
7. Stocks (individual): no. (only as “fun money”)
8. Cryptos: really? (only as “fun money”)
9. Art pieces: not considered as an investment
10. Collectibles: not considered as an investment

### Asset allocation

This asset allocation is referred only to the investible share of my total asset. This is probably the section I will update most frequently.

- 100% Stocks
    - 60% All country world developed
    - 20% Emerging markets
    - 10% Europe developed
    - 10% World small cap

### Cash

- Keep 6 months of living expenses in cash while working.
- In case of urgent need of cash in a bear market, sell bonds first (that I don’t have for now since I don’t need cash in this period of my life).

### Open considerations and problems

- TODO: study and evaluate Value factor and Momentum factor.
- What if I move to Switzerland? Understand tax implications there.
- Buy a house? While I currently have a home in Italy, I probably won’t buy another one in my lifespan, not even as an investment.
- Kids? Too early to know, but one day I’ll have to consider this scenario.
- Prepare my finances for my expected death.
- Prepare my finances for my unexpected death.
